# Poolscore

A pool billard score tracker built with React and Google
Cloud Platform.

Live Version: [poolscore.butz.st](https://poolscore.butz.st/)

## Goal

Create an open-source score tracker which can be used by
different clubs and extended by their needs.

## Development Stage
Currently poolscore only works as an replacement for plain old
score trackers.

In the future the poolscorer will support more features like
online sync of score, matchday/tournament orchestration, a widget
to be included in a homepage, a livestream overlay and more.

## Developer Guide

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For available scripts have a look at the `scripts` section in `package.json`.
